        <p >Coffee shop franchises and fast food outlets have become an increasingly common fixture in India’s urban landscape since the liberalisation of the country’s economy in 1991.</p>

        <p >Armed with free WiFi, they offer a respite from the often unreliable and patchy internet connectivity of outdoor spaces.</p>

        <p >These venues however attract a specific clientele – one that is typically affluent, elite and English-speaking – a tiny fraction of the city’s population. Most middle-class youth in Pune on the other hand live on roughly $2 - $4 per day. <span class="cite">1</span></p>

        <p >Many have never been to a coffee shop or a pizza parlour.</p>

        <p >Most do not own cars, computers or credit cards.</p>

        <p >Economically priced out and excluded from newer establishments in the city that offer free WiFi, they stake out more creative ways of going (and staying) online for long periods of time.</p>
