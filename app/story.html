            <h2>Internet Connection</h2>

            <p>Coffee shop franchises and fast food outlets have become an increasingly common fixture in India’s urban landscape over the past several decades. Armed with free WiFi, they offer a respite from the often unreliable and patchy internet connectivity of outdoor spaces.</p>

            <p>These venues however attract a specific clientele – one that is typically affluent, elite and English-speaking, a tiny fraction of the city’s population. Most middle-class youth in Pune on the other hand live on roughly $2-$4 per day, revealed by a new study claiming the lower-middle class make up two-thirds of the country’s middle classes.</p>

            <p>Many have never been to a coffee shop or a pizza parlour. Most do not own cars, computers or credit cards. Economically priced out and excluded from newer establishments in the city that offer free WiFi, they stake out more creative ways of going (and staying) online for long periods of time.</p>

            <p>A particularly common solution is for friends to share hotspots on their phones with each other. Like the habitual sharing of cups of tea, cigarettes and snacks with each other, the sharing of the internet forms a new ritual of friendship.</p>

            <h2>Selfie</h2>
            
            <p>In India, the selfie has taken on epic proportions. Splashed across billboards are images of Bollywood stars and sporting icons inviting you to enter a world of digital possibilities through the selfie. Even the Prime Minister’s fondness for the selfie is well known.</p> 
            
            <p>In reality, the selfie is a far more precarious space. Young people in Pune are quick to judge each other based on their selfies. The selfies of upper middle-class youth feature cafes, pubs and restaurants as backdrops.</p> 
            
            <p>For lower-middle class youth unable to access these spaces, they commonly pose on their motorbikes - their most prized possession and often their only means of travel.</p>
            
            <p>They also turn the selfie into a visual spectacle. Bursting with colour through extreme filters, overexposure and blurred out backgrounds, the selfie becomes instantly ‘digital’ rather than reflective of their more mundane reality. By making their digital manipulation explicit, they, too, mould themselves into modern, tech-savvy Indians.</p>
