        <h3>Internet Connection</h3>

        <p>Coffee shop franchises and fast food outlets have become an increasingly common fixture in India’s urban landscape since the liberalisation of the country’s economy in 1991.</p>

        <p>Armed with free WiFi, they offer a respite from the often unreliable and patchy internet connectivity of outdoor spaces.</p>

        <p>These venues however attract a specific clientele – one that is typically affluent, elite and English-speaking – a tiny fraction of the city’s population. Most middle-class youth in Pune on the other hand live on roughly $2 - $4 per day. <span class="cite">1</span></p>
      </div>

      <img src="images/story-photo-2.jpg" alt="">

      <div class="container">
        <p>Many have never been to a coffee shop or a pizza parlour.</p>

        <p>Most do not own cars, computers or credit cards.</p> 

        <p>Economically priced out and excluded from newer establishments in the city that offer free WiFi, they stake out more creative ways of going (and staying) online for long periods of time.</p>
      </div>

      <img src="images/story-photo-3.jpg" alt="">

      <div class="container">
        <p>A particularly common solution is for friends to share hotspots on their phones with each other.</p> 

        <p>Like the habitual sharing of cups of tea, cigarettes and snacks, the sharing of the internet forms a new ritual of friendship.</p>

        <p class="citation"><span class="cite">1</span> A 2017 study by economists Sandhya Krishnan and Neeraj Hatekar found that the lower-middle class make up two-thirds of India’s middle classes.</p>

        <h3>The Selfie</h3>

        <p>In India, the selfie has taken on epic proportions.</p>

        <p>Splashed across billboards and shop windows are images of Bollywood stars and sporting icons inviting you to enter a world of digital possibilities through the selfie. Even the Prime Minister’s fondness for the selfie is well known.</p>

        <p>For young people in Pune, the selfie is a far more precarious space.</p>

      <img src="images/story-photo-5.jpg" alt="">

      <div class="container">
        <p>They are quick to judge each other based on their selfies. The selfies of upper middle-class youth feature cafes, pubs and restaurants as backdrops.</p>

        <p>For lower-middle class youth unable to access these spaces, they commonly pose on their motorbikes - their most prized possession and often their only means of travel.</p> 

        <p>They also turn the selfie into a visual spectacle, adding emojis, multiple filters, and pixelated backgrounds, sometimes even replacing them to feature entirely new ones.</p> 

        <p>By making their digital manipulation explicit, they, too, mould themselves into modern, tech-savvy Indians.</p>

        <h3>Check In</h3>

        <p>The worldwide proliferation of social media has sparked fears that young people are becoming increasingly socially isolated and prone to depression, foregoing physical friendship for chatting online from the confines of their bedrooms. </p>

        <p>Sherry Turkle, professor at M.I.T, predicts that mobile phones are making us “alone together”.</p>
      </div>

      <img src="images/story-photo-6.jpg" alt="">

      <div class="container">
        <p>In Pune however, youth rarely use social media in isolation.</p>

        <p>Rather, they go online to spark offline social interaction, often ‘checking in’ at various locations on Facebook to see if any friends are nearby with whom they can meet.</p>

        <p>As they leave behind their digital traces online, these become markers for their friends online to locate them in real time.</p>
      </div>

      <img src="images/story-photo-7.jpg" alt="">

      <div class="container">
        <p>Checking-in, however, is about more than just finding friends; it is also about reimagining the city as filled with endless fun.</p>

        <p>Like many other cities in India, processes of gentrification and the creation of spatial enclaves in Pune produce further divisions between rich and poor.</p> 

        <p>In contesting their marginalisation, lower-middle class youth digitize their own spaces of friendship, creating a new map of the city for themselves.</p>
