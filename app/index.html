        <h2>Growing up online and offline in an Indian city </h2>
        
        <p>In a country where the internet carries the hopes, dreams and desires of a whole new generation, this website explores what it means to come of age as a young person in India, both in real life and on the internet.</p>
         
        <p>Based on seven months of ethnographic fieldwork studying the everyday lives of lower-middle class youth in Pune, this website captures a day in the life of a typical college student in a north Indian city.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the IT boom city of Pune, India. Just a three-hour drive from Mumbai, what once used to be a sleepy resort town is now one of India's fastest growing cities. It is also host to a vibrant student population, giving it the nickname 'The Oxford of the East'.</p>
         
        <p>For many young people in Pune, it is through the smartphone that they first experience the internet. Leapfrogging over the desktop computer and the laptop, young people form the driving force behind India's digital revolution.</p>
        
        <p>With 241 million active users, India now has the highest number of Facebook users in the world, and an even bigger untapped reserve - 70% of Indiaâ€™s population is yet to come online.</p>
