          <p>Welcome to the IT boom city of Pune, India. Just a three-hour drive from Mumbai, what once used to be a sleepy resort town is now one of India's fastest growing cities. It is also host to a vibrant student population, giving it the nickname 'The Oxford of the East'.</p>
           
          <p>For many young people in Pune, it is through the smartphone that they first experience the internet. Leapfrogging over the desktop computer and the laptop, young people form the driving force behind India's digital revolution.</p>
          
          <p>With 241 million active users, India now has the highest number of Facebook users in the world, and an even bigger untapped reserve - 70% of India’s population is yet to come online.</p>
